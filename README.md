# Simple DFINITY Voting Project

Welcome to your `mini-project` and to the Internet Computer development community! This project serves as a small-scale demonstration (`mini-project`) designed for workshops and basic learning about building decentralized applications (dApps) on the DFINITY Internet Computer (IC) platform.

By default, creating a new DFINITY project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

**The primary goals of this project are to demonstrate:**

* **Internet Identity Integration:** How users can securely log in to a dApp using their decentralized identity.
* **Frontend-Backend Interaction:** How a React frontend application communicates with a smart contract (canister) running on the Internet Computer blockchain.
* **On-Chain Data Persistence:** How data (voting results) are stored permanently and securely directly on the blockchain.
* **Building Simple Smart Contracts:** An example of basic smart contract functions in Motoko for managing voting data.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Login:** Users log in using Internet Identity, ensuring each vote originates from a unique identity.
* **Unique Voting:** Each Principal identity can cast only one vote.
* **Real-time Results:** Displays live voting results in a simple bar chart.
* **User Information:** Shows the Principal ID of the currently logged-in user.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to grasp the fundamental concepts of DFINITY and understand how to build "end-to-end" fully decentralized applications.

### Technologies Used in This Project:

* **DFINITY Internet Computer:** The decentralized cloud platform hosting the application.
* **Motoko:** The purpose-built programming language for writing smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer (for the backend).
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface (frontend).
* **JavaScript:** The primary language for frontend logic and interaction with the DFINITY SDK.
* **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web application.
* **AuthClient (`@dfinity/auth-client`):** DFINITY SDK module for managing Internet Identity authentication.
* **Recharts:** A React charting library used for visualizing voting results.

### Running the Project Locally (For Workshop & Development)

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

1.  **Ensure you have the `dfx` CLI installed.**
2.  **Clone this repository.**
3.  **Navigate into your project directory:** `cd mini-project/` (replace `mini-project` with your actual project folder name if different).

    ```bash
    # Starts the replica, running in the background. Use --clean to reset all canister state.
    dfx start --background --clean

    # Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
    dfx deploy
    ```
    Once the job completes, your backend canister will be deployed.

4.  **Navigate into the frontend directory:** `cd src/mini-project-frontend`

    ```bash
    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the frontend development server
    npm start
    ```
    This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

5.  **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by `npm start`).

**Note:** If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new Candid interface with `npm run generate` at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

### Frontend Environment Variables (Advanced Note)

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

* Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack.
* Use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations.
    * Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations.
* Write your own `createActor` constructor.
