// Description: This canister serves as the backend for a simple voting application.
//          It allows users to log in using Internet Identity,
//          cast a unique vote for one of three programming languages,
//          and view the voting results in real-time.

// Import essential modules from the Motoko base library.
import Nat           "mo:base/Nat";       // Used for natural numbers (non-negative integers).
import Principal     "mo:base/Principal";  // Used to identify users (principal IDs).
import HashMap       "mo:base/HashMap";    // Data structure for storing key-value pairs.
// import Debug         "mo:base/Debug";      // Debugging module, commented out as not actively used.

// Declaration of the main canister actor.
